 * This software is an interactive intermedia sequencer.
 * It allows the precise and flexible scripting of interactive scenarios.
 * In contrast to most sequencers, i-score doesn’t produce any media, 
 * but controls other environments’ parameters, by creating snapshots 
 * and automations, and organizing them in time in a multi-linear way.
 * More about i-score on http://www.i-score.org
