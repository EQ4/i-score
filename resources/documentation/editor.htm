Devices can be added to i-score, by clicking the "Add a device" button. This will let you choose the several options of your device, according to the communication protocol that it uses.	  
Devices will then appear in the inspector, and can then be explored hierarchically by browsing their nodes and subnodes, down to the addresses that hold actual parameters.

Addresses and set of addresses can be selected in the devices tree.
Selecting a node will select all descendants of this node.
Once a selection is done,  clicking on "start" or "end" will take a snapshot of this selection, and assign it respectively to the start or end of the selected box.
